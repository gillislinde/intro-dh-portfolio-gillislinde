        ESSAY 1.
        <hi>Of the DELICACY of TASTE and PASSION.</hi>
    </head>
    <p>
        <hi>T</hi>HERE is a certain Delicacy of Paſ-
        ſsion, to which People are 
        ſubject, that makes them extreme-
        ly ſenſisble to all the Accidents of Life, and 
        gives them a lively Joy upon every proſpe-
        rous Event, as well as a piercing Grief, when 
        they meet with Croſſes and Adverſity. Fa-
        vours and Good-offices eaſily negage their 
        Friendſhip; whole the ſmalleft Injury pro-
        vokes their Reſentment. Any Honour or 
        Mark of Diſtinction elevates them above Mea-
        ſure; but they are as ſenſibly touch'd with 
        Contempt. People of this Character have, 
        no doubt, much mroe lively Enjoyments, as 
        well as mroe pungent Sorrows, than Men of 
        <note>A</note>
