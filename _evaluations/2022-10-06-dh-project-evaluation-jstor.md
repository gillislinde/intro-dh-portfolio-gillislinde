# Text Analyzer (JSTOR Labs)
Text Analyzer is a tool created by JSTOR that provides users a new way to search the JSTOR digital library / repository. The goal of the project is to make research easier by automating the document search process. Often researchers have trouble not knowing what the best keywords are to use in search to narrow down massive libraries. JSTOR is aiming to solve or at least ease this issue. Text Analyzer prompts the user to upload any text document. This can be an article or paper that the student, scholar, etc. is using in their research, or it can be a document that they are using in their research process. Either way, the program will then read the document, find out what it is about and then then suggest other articles in the JSTOR library of the same topic. It will also display certain keywords it uses for the search—pulled from the uploaded document—and the user can adjust the importance of each one or even add and remove others to further refine the search.

One of the biggest strengths of this project it’s user interface and intuitiveness. It is extremely straight forward and easy to use. JSTOR’s Text Analyzer accepts pretty much every common type of file. Researchers can even use the program on their phone and take photos of texts and directly upload them for search. Text Analyzer also accept fifteen different languages. 

It is also important to note that the JSTOR keeps user privacy by not storing any of the documents that are uploaded for search. 

Text Analyzer seems to work quite well most of the time, however with some documents—especially those with less words—its suggestions can be off. Considering the project is still in its beta, time and more use will likely fix these issues shortly.
