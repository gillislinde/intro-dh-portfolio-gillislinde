# The Humanities by Willem Drees

Without a steadfast definition of a topic, it is hard to research and learn about said topic. In chapter one of What are the Humanities For? titled “The Humanities,” Willem B. Drees reviews possible definitions of the term “humanities,” other scholars’ definitions, and provides his own “tentative definition” for the subject onto which he is able to base rest of his book. Dree’s first humanities description is as follows, “the humanities include a plurality of scholarly disciplines such as the study of history, languages, religions, and art from various times and places, and often comparatively, linguistics, literary studies cultural studies, philosophy, religious studies, and area studies.” This definition is successful in that it gives the reader a general idea of what is included in the broad topic of the humanities but fails at identifying the goals of the research in the various. Ultimately, Drees settles on this so-called tentative definition: 

“Humanities are academic disciplines in which humans seek understanding of human self-understandings and self-expressions, and of the ways in which people thereby construct and experience the world they live in.”

While this definition doesn’t explicitly list the “disciplines,” it gives a much better understanding of what the goals and purpose of the subject. It also brings up the idea of different orders of activity defining it as a second-order activity—the academic study of human action. 

Another interesting topic that Drees brings up is the difference between agents and actors. He references Martin Hollis’s The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction. Agents being “all entities that change their environment” and actors are those who have intentions for said actions. Drees emphasizes the importance of considering humans as agents and actors and focusing on the actor aspect—studying the intentions of human actions is the basis of humanities. From this distinction the next step is looking at the explanation and understanding of behaviors.
