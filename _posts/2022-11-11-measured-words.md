 ## The Measured Words: How Computers Analyze Text

Galatea 2.2 is the story an artificial intelligence named Helen that learns to interpret English literature at the level of a Master of Arts student. The story highlights the idea that while computers and AI can be programed to work with the humanities, the computers’ interpretations lack the experience that humans get from reading and analyzing literature. More importantly, the relationship that readers develop with the humanities is crucial to said interpretations and said AI lacks this ability. Galatea demonstrates this idea by Helen's decision to terminate her own program after realizing that she can never experience the world that is depicted in the literature. 

Digital information is encoded in binary language for the use of programming languages to manipulate that information for various purposes. Programming languages built on logic can be used to do many tasks—check spelling, paint, or analyze text to name a few. However, there is sharp limitations in computers’ text analysis skills. Clearly, with today’s technology, they do not have the ability to analyze with graduate level skills like Helen in Galatea was able to. “In the slippage between our literary notion of a text and the computer’s literal processing lie the disappointment and the possibility of text analysis.” Computers can’t understand a piece of literature like we can; however, they provide useful tools that can aid analysis that would otherwise be impossible. 

Measured Words also raises questions about the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI and interpretive machines in society. As technology has got better, this has become even more important. While there are many benefits to the use of computers, there is a danger to become too dependent on technology, especially when it comes to learning. We need to use technology to enhance the way we learn, not replace it. While technology isn’t good enough to replace higher education learning, like in Galatea, it can be disruptive to learning at a young age. New technology, like ChatGPT, as we discussed in class, will likely be destructive to young minds. AIs can offer students an easy way to cheat or at least take short cuts and ultimately hinder them from learning; however, if used correctly technology can be a great aid to students’ education.
