# The History of the Decine and Fall of the Roman Empire

WIn Gibbon’s book, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, he attempts to provide a definitive explanation to why the Roman Empire fell. The reading summarizes Edward Gibbon’s book, but more importantly provides an overview of the subsequent criticism the book received for its theses. 

Edward Gibbons claims that the fall was caused by the barbarian invasions, the “gradual loss of civic virtue among its citizens,” and finally the Romans adoption of Christianity. He even goes as far to say that the question shouldn’t be why did the empire collapse, but rather how did they last so long. 

The biggest criticisms for Gibbon and his work came from his views on religion—both for Christianity’s involvement in the Roman Empire’s decline and his own description of Jewish faith. His claim that Christianity had a large impact on the fall is widely unaccepted by historians. Gibbon’s assertion is that the massive amounts of wealth that was collected by the church could have and should have been spent on secular affairs to better defend and unite the empire. However, prior to Christianity the empire still spent heaps of money on religion, and it isn’t known if Christianity made it go up higher. Additionally, his claims that Christians became monastics and stopped supporting the empire is irrelevant because they paled in comparison to those who supported. His other criticism and claims of anti-Semitism are due to his portrayal of Jewish people in his book describing them as “a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but also of humankind.” Gibbon easily could have just said that they were enemies of the Roman Empire, but his description and claim that they are enemies of humankind, was uncalled for and completely unnecessary for point he was trying to make.
