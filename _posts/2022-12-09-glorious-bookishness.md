# Glorious Bookishness by Michael F. Saurez, S.J.

In Michael Saurez’s TED Talk, he makes a compelling argument through anecdotes of his experiences as a child, and later as a teacher, that the wonder and desire of education is brought out through the experience model versus the broadcast cast model that has become the norm in education today. By the broadcast model he means a teacher standing in front of a room and simply lecturing at the students without the use of interactive learning. The experience model he preaches is one of slowing down and examining things, especially physical objects, that will better capture the attention of students. He tells stories of how you can learn so much from physical copies of books and actually judging them by their cover. Most people neglect the cover, following the traditional saying; however, there is a lot to learn about a book from its cover. As he shows a book from the civil war era that looks dim and sad but has absolutely nothing to do with the civil war, he says that “books reflect the mood of the nation” and the “moment in which they were made.” He often finds students disillusioned by old literature classes. Remembering he felt this way at one point, he brings out physical copies for his students to get them excited about the content and think deeper about it. 

His talk resonated with me a lot. While schools have tried to implement more classroom interaction and limit lecturing in recent years, I haven’t heard many people talk about the impact of physical objects and especially how it can be applied to areas outside of science. His anecdote of collecting water samples as a kid to put under the microscope reminded me of myself. Science has an edge in the sense that its easier for physical activities to encourage the wonder of learning, but like he said, it can be applied to many other areas of study. As students get older, its harder to implement the physical, but to keep engagement with things that seem abstract to students, it becomes more import. So, the question is how can we push this message? Suarez is doing his part, but in order to inspire we need the school systems on board. However, there are clear obstacles as this kind of learning requires much more resources and money.
